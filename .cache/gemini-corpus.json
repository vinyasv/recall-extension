    "content": "CSS animations provide a performant and relatively simple way to create engaging visual effects on the web. The core of CSS animations lies in the `@keyframes` rule, which defines the sequence of styles that an element will transition through.\n\nWithin `@keyframes`, you specify different points in the animation timeline (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100%) and the corresponding CSS properties for each point. The browser then smoothly interpolates between these states, creating the animation.\n\nFor instance, to c",

    "content": "The 'Holy Grail' layout, consisting of a header, footer, main content area, and two sidebars, is a classic web layout challenge. CSS Flexbox provides a clean and efficient way to achieve this structure.\n\nBy setting the `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` properties on the container, you create a vertical flex container. The header and footer can then be fixed heights, while the main content area expands to fill the remaining space.\n\nTo create the sidebars, nest another flex container wi",

Flexbox is your go-to for simple content centering. `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;` on the parent container will center its direct children both horizontally and vertically. For single line text or inline elements, `text-align: center;` often suffices. Grid layout provides another option. Using `place-items: center;",

    "content": "Organizing your JavaScript code into modules is crucial for maintainability and preventing namespace collisions. The Module Pattern helps achieve this. It leverages closures to create private and public scopes within a function. A basic module is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object. This object exposes only the methods and properties you want to be publicly accessible. Variables declared within the IIFE are private and cannot be accessed directly from outside",

The `srcset` attribute of the `<img>` tag allows you to specify multiple image sources, each with its own width or pixel density. The browser then chooses the most suitable image based on the device's characteristics. Example: `<img src=\"default.jpg\" srcset=\"small.jpg 320w, medium.jpg 640w, large.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"My Image\">`. The `sizes` attribute can further refine the selection based on viewport size",

You define the different states of your animation at specific points in time (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100%). The browser smoothly transitions between these states. To define a keyframe animation, use the `@keyframes` rule, giving it a name. Then, within the rule, specify the styles for each keyframe. Example: `@keyframes fadeIn { from { opacity: 0; } to { opacity: 1; } }`. To apply the animation to an element, use the",

Then, define the column sizes using `grid-template-columns`. For example, `grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;` creates two columns, the first 200 pixels wide and the second taking up the remaining available space. You can use other units like percentages or `fr` units (fractional units) to define column widths. You can control the g",
